		<ul>Known Bugs:
			<li>Duplicate videos</li>
			<li>video doesn't resize with window (great, how does this affect the rounding correction?</li>
			<li>no options</li>
			<li>server side rounding correction may cause different aspect ratio than the client video is sized to (do same correction in js also? do it in js instead? <em>Doing it in JS would allow users to request the wrong aspect ratio, could be a good thing, would need to document the metadata of the original aspect ratio. This could also be done as filters /download/&lt;file_id&gt;/filter:width=500,height=400/filter:crop:500/stream.{flv,webm}</li>
